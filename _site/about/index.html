    <h1>About My Research</h1>
    <div class="article-wrap">
      <p>Hello- I’m Benjamin Bengfort, a graduate research assistant studying distributed file systems with <a href="http://pete.kelehers.me/">Dr. Pete Keleher</a>. This is my academic and professional profile page on the CS website.</p>

<p>There are two questions you should never ask a graduate student: “when will you finish?” and “what are you working on?”. So I’ll try to answer them here for you in the most oblique way possible.</p>

<h2 id="what-year-are-you">What Year Are You?</h2>

<p>I have good taste in advisors, and am now up to 5 distinguished mentors in my academic career, which started at North Dakota State University, took a pit stop at UMBC, and is now concluding at the University of Maryland. Generally the promotion of my advisors to other institutions has led to a rather tumultuous academic career, observable in the wide breadth of topics of my academic publications.</p>

<p>It is perhaps for this reason that I have a hard time answering the question, “what year are you?” I am either in my third year or my eighth, depending on who you ask and the mood of the Graduate School. But what I can’t deny, is that due to gaps, fits, and starts in my pursuit of the academic dream, I do have a more comprehensive work experience than some of my fellow, younger classmates. As a result, I’m much more comfortable answering the question “why do you want your PhD?” than they are, particularly as my graduate experience has not been to improve my opportunity to acquire a job (nor in the pursuit of a University position), but rather is an investment in myself so that I can pursue something that will change the world.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-work-on">What Do You Work On?</h2>

<p>My professional career has been one of startups, large and small. Being in a startup is hard, it requires commitment, dedication, and a little bit of self-sacrifice. But the entrepreneurial spirit of taking risks to do something big, often makes those difficulties worth it. Although the fixtures are changed, pursuing a PhD requires that same entrepreneurial character, a willingness to be a jack-of-all-trades, to do what needs to be done if only to make a small contribution to human knowledge. I believe that the disruptive influence of startup culture, combined with my varied academic background has made me able to think and see new opportunities, integrations, and cross-disciplinary approaches that I have brought to my research at the University of Maryland.</p>

<p>Now at last I’m approaching the final stretch of my academic career. I have completed the course requirements at the University of Maryland and am preparing for my proposal and oral exam. I have also started a research assistantship to study distributed file systems, particularly consistency in user-oriented small scale networks (like the ones between your phone and laptop). I am hoping to create a distributed file system that allows for permanent data that follows you and your devices, and which cannot be corrupted or mangled.</p>
