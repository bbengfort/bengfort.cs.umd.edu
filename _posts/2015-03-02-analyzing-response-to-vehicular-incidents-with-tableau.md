In the State of Maryland, the State Highway Administration (MDSHA) oversees critical responses
to events and incidents that occur on the roadways, 24 hours a day - 7 days a week. Maryland has
some of the highest density traffic in the United States [4], and includes two major beltways (ring
roads) around Baltimore and Washington, I-695 and I-495 respectively. It is therefore critical that
first responders are prepared for changing road conditions and are able to plan well in advance for
management of routine and extraordinary events.

At the University of Maryland, the Center for Advanced Transportation Technology (CATT) Laboratory
explores user and visualization driven techniques to solve complex challenges of transportation,
safety, and security for the Maryland region. Recently, data collection efforts have improved
and large scale probe networks have equipped traffic operations specialists with real time probe data
for dynamic monitoring. The CATT Lab has shown that with effective, real-time visualization
of traffic patterns and event analysis, traffic administrators are able to respond more quickly and
prepare in advance.

With the support of Maryland State Highway Administration’s Incident Management System, the
CATT Laboratory has collected 287,712 events that Maryland Coordinated Highway Action Response
Teams (CHARTs) responded to from 2011 - 2014. In this paper we use Tableau to explore
patterns in historical responses to these events and critique Tableau’s effectiveness as a data analysis
tool for response preparedness. We hope to show that a commercial tool for general data analysis
like Tableau can provide insights from large amounts of data, and allow first responders to plan and
prepare for future events.
