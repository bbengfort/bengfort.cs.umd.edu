Developing in Python is very different from developing in other languages. Python is an interpreted language like Ruby or Perl, so developers are able to use read-evaluate-print loops (REPLs) to execute Python in real-time. This feature of Python means that it can be used for rapid development and prototyping because there is no build process. Python includes many functional programming tools akin to Scala or Javascript to assist with closure based script development. But Python is also a fully scalable object-oriented language, a paradigm used to build large modular software rather than to simply execute scripts, more akin to Java or C++.

Python sits in the middle of these paradigms, providing the best of many worlds. Python is used for writing quick one-off scripts, large scale web frameworks like Django, data processing with Celery, even numerical and scientific computing. Python is lightweight, is standard on many operating systems, and is effective, thereby making it the top choice for data scientists and analysts for data engineering and analytical tasks.

However, the breadth of Python means that there is no one workflow to developing with it, and certainly there is no standard IDE or environment framework to make these decisions on your behalf. Most Python educational materials focus on the scripting aspects of the language, leaving out the important details of how to construct larger projects. This post will focus on the question of how a developer interacts with Python to build larger data applications.
