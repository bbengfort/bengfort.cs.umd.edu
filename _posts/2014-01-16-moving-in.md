Hi, I'm Ben. Today, for the fourth time, I'm starting over on my PhD. I've
moved into my office in A.V. Williams, and I'm feeling like a veteran
entering an extended tour. But I'm here, I'm ready to work, so let's get
researching!

Also, I do Python.

{% highlight python %}
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)

print map(fib, range(0, 10))
#=> prints '[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I build this site with [Jekyll][jekyll], which builds the static site from
Markdown in a repository.
