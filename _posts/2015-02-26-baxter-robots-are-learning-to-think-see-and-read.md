    <strong><small>Researchers at the University of Maryland explore practical AI with Baxter Robots</small></strong>
</p>

In April 2014, researchers at the University of Maryland acquired two Baxter Intera 3 humanoid robots manufactured by Rethink Robotics.  Baxter robots are well known for their use in micro-manufacturing as they are specially designed for repeated grasping and moving tasks in a stationary position.  While a Baxter's multi-dimensional range of motion is important, What makes them especially interesting is their adaptability. Baxter robots are “trained” -- not programmed -- on work sites.  Human workers move the Baxter’s incredibly flexible robotic arms to “show” Baxter how to do a particular task. This ability, combined with Baxter's powerful onboard processing, a suite of sensors, and smooth operating mechanisms makes Baxter ideal for research.

In Computer Science, research groups have already begun to explore computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence within a robotic context. Three research groups — the Computer Vision Labratory (CFAR), the Metacognitive Lab (MCL), and the Maryland Robotics Center — have been cooperating to produce practical results from their individual theoretical fields.  Simple tasks like picking up utensils and stirring bowls, pouring water in a moving container, and building structures from blocks have been quickly achieved thanks to this collaboration.  By studying the difficulties involved in teaching Baxter to perform these tasks, the research groups hope to solve larger theoretical challenges.
