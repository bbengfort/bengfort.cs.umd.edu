Once again I've made a very difficult and also very exciting choice to switch my research topic away from case based reasoning and knowledge goals to distributed storage systems. Today it's official: I've received my RA letter to start work with [Dr. Pete Keleher](http://pete.kelehers.me/), my new advisor. Starting on January 4, 2016: I will move forward on the implementation of a project that I started in his class in the Fall 2014 semester (incidentally, my favorite class at the University of Maryland). Hopefully this project will allow me to become much better at the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), my newly preferred systems programming language, and possibly also produce research papers so that I can graduate at some point.

## What Went Down

As you might know if you've been following my research career, (or at the very least noticed the wide variety of topics on my publications page) I've had several advisors to this point. My personal statement even mentions that I'm extremely good luck to academic professionals, as shortly after advising me, they tend to get promotions and move to other universities! The honor role now includes:

- [Dr. Xiao-jiang Du](http://cis-linux1.temple.edu/~xjdu/) who worked with me while I studied hybrid wireless networks at NDSU and is now the Chair of Future Computing at Temple University.
- [Dr. Weiyi Zhang](http://maxzhang.info/) with whom I finished my master's thesis, now at AT&T Laboratories.
- [Dr. Sergei Nirenburg](http://www.hass.rpi.edu/pl/faculty-staff-s17/nirenburg) who encouraged me to continue my PhD and shift to Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence and now has a joint position at RPI in Cognitive Science and Computer Science.
- [Dr. Michael Cox](http://mcox.org/) who took me in to continue my research I started with Dr. Nirenburg at UMD, and is now a senior research scientist at Wright State Research Institute.

I consider myself especially fortunate having had such distinguished mentors who have taught me how to conduct research and equipped me with a broad background in several computer science fields.

My most recent advisor at Maryland, Dr. Cox, actually received his appointment last summer and moved shortly thereafter. I continued to work with him remotely for a year. However, as I have come closer to completing my requirements and move to my oral exam and proposal; the University of Maryland was concerned that I have a resident advisor in order to complete the process. I spoke with many professors at UMD who might take over as chair of my committee, but most felt that my work was too far outside of their research area. It was with great regret that Dr. Cox and I had to move forward in different directions.

## What's Next

I've long been interested in distributed systems and databases, and most of my professional work is a combination of distributed systems and machine learning. The move to work with Dr. Keleher seems like a great fit, and although it is a drastic shift from my previous work; it is very comfortable to me from an applied standpoint. Moreover, his class well prepared me for pursuing research in this area, and I don't feel like I'm starting from scratch.

In particular I will be looking at consistency in small-scale distributed file systems; e.g. those that users might use, not those that exist on a cluster. This is a fascinating topic that I hope will have a large impact. Hopefully I will also be able to publish significant enough results that I can move to my dissertation and wrap up in a timely fashion.
