Hello- I'm Benjamin Bengfort, a graduate research assistant studying distributed file systems with [Dr. Pete Keleher](http://pete.kelehers.me/). This is my academic and professional profile page on the CS website.

There are two questions you should never ask a graduate student: &ldquo;when will you finish?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what are you working on?&rdquo;. So I'll try to answer them here for you in the most oblique way possible.

## What Year Are You?

I have good taste in advisors, and am now up to 5 distinguished mentors in my academic career, which started at North Dakota State University, took a pit stop at UMBC, and is now concluding at the University of Maryland. Generally the promotion of my advisors to other institutions has led to a rather tumultuous academic career, observable in the wide breadth of topics of my academic publications.

It is perhaps for this reason that I have a hard time answering the question, &ldquo;what year are you?&rdquo; I am either in my third year or my eighth, depending on who you ask and the mood of the Graduate School. But what I can't deny, is that due to gaps, fits, and starts in my pursuit of the academic dream, I do have a more comprehensive work experience than some of my fellow, younger classmates. As a result, I'm much more comfortable answering the question &ldquo;why do you want your PhD?&rdquo; than they are, particularly as my graduate experience has not been to improve my opportunity to acquire a job (nor in the pursuit of a University position), but rather is an investment in myself so that I can pursue something that will change the world.

## What Do You Work On?

My professional career has been one of startups, large and small. Being in a startup is hard, it requires commitment, dedication, and a little bit of self-sacrifice. But the entrepreneurial spirit of taking risks to do something big, often makes those difficulties worth it. Although the fixtures are changed, pursuing a PhD requires that same entrepreneurial character, a willingness to be a jack-of-all-trades, to do what needs to be done if only to make a small contribution to human knowledge. I believe that the disruptive influence of startup culture, combined with my varied academic background has made me able to think and see new opportunities, integrations, and cross-disciplinary approaches that I have brought to my research at the University of Maryland.

Now at last I'm approaching the final stretch of my academic career. I have completed the course requirements at the University of Maryland and am preparing for my proposal and oral exam. I have also started a research assistantship to study distributed file systems, particularly consistency in user-oriented small scale networks (like the ones between your phone and laptop). I am hoping to create a distributed file system that allows for permanent data that follows you and your devices, and which cannot be corrupted or mangled.
