Hello- I'm Benjamin Bengfort, a graduate research assistant studying in the Metacognition Lab at the University of Maryland with Dr. Cox and Dr. Perlis. This is my academic and professional profile page on the CS website.

My research interests currently include Goal Driven Autonomy (GDA) and Mixed-Initiative and Multi-Agent systems. Part of this work is faciliated by a study of Semantic Meaning Representations of Text. My approach typically involves Active Logic as the top down approach, and ensembles of classifiers (Multi-Strategy Learning) for the bottom up component.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy cooking and BBQ- every year I host both St. Patty's Day and Oktoberfest at my house with a 12 hour BBQ of smoked brisket and pork shoulder; you should try to get yourself invited! I also enjoy swimming and bike riding, as well as hiking- and if I have to (and my wife says I do), running. Speaking of, I have a wonderful wife and daughter.
